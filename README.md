# Restaurant Picker

<strong>Intro:</strong><br>
This is a restaurant picker created in Python that my co-workers and I use to keep track of the restaurants around us and help us determine which restaurant we want to eat at.
<hr>
<strong>To Open:</strong><br>
To use the restaurant picker you need to have Python installed on your machine. Simply download the file. You will see a file named *restaurant-picker.py* that you will need to run.
<hr>
<strong>To Use:</strong><br>
Following the directions in the program you have the option to randomize a restaurant to eat at, view all the restaurants in the dictionary,
add a restaurant and delete a restaurant.
<hr>
<strong>Future Updates:</strong><br>
I plan on having the capability to narrow down the restaurants by cuisine then randomize that list.
